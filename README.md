#Music History Project
This project was a project assigned by Nashville Software School at the beginning of the front-end curriculum. Whenever a new technology was learned we were asked to implement it in this project. Therefore, the commits on this project display a timeline of my learning during the front-end portion of my time at Nashville Software School.
